This script uses the **`requests`** library to make a GET request to a given URL and the **`BeautifulSoup`** library to parse the HTML content of the page. It then uses the **`find_all`** method from BeautifulSoup to search for specific HTML elements (links, images, forms) and prints the number of each type of element found on the page.

This script will give you an idea of the number of links, images and forms on the webpage but it doesn't check the validity of the links, images or forms.
You can add more functionality as per your requirement.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def analyze_web_app(url):
# Make a GET request to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

```
# Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Print the number of links on the page
links = soup.find_all('a')
print(f'Number of links: {len(links)}')

# Print the number of images on the page
images = soup.find_all('img')
print(f'Number of images: {len(images)}')

# Print the number of forms on the page
forms = soup.find_all('form')
print(f'Number of forms: {len(forms)}')

```

# Example usage

analyze_web_app('[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)')
